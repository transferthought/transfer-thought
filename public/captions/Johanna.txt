It's not easy...little Jay is breastfeeding a lot these days.
Well it feels like I never sleep and we have these meetings so early.
I drive here and you know they just changed the baby seat requirements. Jay isn't a big baby but he does take up a lot of room lengthï¿½wise. He also doesn't sleep much it seems like. Did I say that already?
I feel like I'm dominating the conversation.
